## Introduction

This exercise revolves around "Rock, Paper, Scissors".


## Exercise

We just watched a [video](https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/rspec-3-best-practices) showing TDD in conjunction with RSpec 3.

Implement your own version of "Rock, Paper, Scissors". Try and go top down and use all that RSpec has to offer.


## Notes

For the avoidance of doubt:

* Rock beats Scissors
* Paper beats Rock
* Scissors beats Paper
