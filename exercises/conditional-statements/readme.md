# Conditional Statements


## Introduction

We can't do much without logic. The following tasks are a couple of computing problems that you may have seen before.


## Objective

Start to get familiar with some of the conditional expressions in Ruby.


## Tasks


### Task 1

Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a given list using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion.


### Task 2

Write a function that combines two lists by alternatingly taking elements.

For example:

```ruby
# Given the two lists...

list_one = [a, b, c]
lsit_two = [1, 2, 3]

# The end result should be...

[a, 1, b, 2, c, 3]
```


### Task 3

Write a function that computes the list of the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.

By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

As an example, here are the first 10 Fibonnaci numbers: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34`.


## Notes

_Note: If you want to define a method or two during this exercise, you can do this by:_

```ruby
def your_method_name(arg_one, arg_two)
  # some
  # code
  # here

  return_value # this is returned from your method
end
```


## Extension

What does the `and` keyword do? Is there anything special about it?
